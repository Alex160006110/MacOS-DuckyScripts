REM VNC is a technology that allows you to remotely control another computer. 
REM In this case, if the VNC server is started on a Mac, you can view 
REM and control that Mac from another computer using a VNC viewer application.



REM Creates a temporary directory called "phantom_vnc" in the "/tmp" directory and navigates into it.
REM Creates a script file called "vnc_start.sh", 
REM which contains the command to start the MacOS built-in VNC server
REM creates another script "vnc_stop.sh" that contains a command to stop the VNC server. 
REM It then changes the permissions of these files to be executable using the chmod command.
REM Executes the "vnc_start.sh" script to start the VNC server.
REM Finally, it clears the Terminal history and exits Terminal.
