REM Replace the "Your API Access token Here" placeholder with your actual Dropbox API token. line 13
REM Replace the "File Name" placeholder with the name of the file you intend to download from dropbox
REM Replace the "Dropbox File Path" placeholder with the path of the file you want to download from Dropbox

	"--header \"Authorization: Bearer " & ACCESS_TOKEN & "\" " & ¬
	"--header \"Dropbox-API-Arg: {\\\"path\\\": \\\"" & FILE_PATH & "\\\"}\" " & ¬
	"--output \"" & SAVE_PATH & "\""
