<h4 align="center">
<p>Welcome to the Reconnaissance repository!</p>

<p>This repository is dedicated to the topic of Reconnaissance in cybersecurity. It provides information, resources, and tools related to various aspects of Reconnaissance.</p>
</h4>


## Introduction

<p>Reconnaissance is the process of gathering information and intelligence about a target, typically used in cybersecurity to assess vulnerabilities and plan targeted attacks. This repository aims to educate and provide resources about the different aspects of Reconnaissance.</p>

## Types of Reconnaissance

<h4>
<ol>
  <li>Passive Reconnaissance: This involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target. It includes techniques like open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, analyzing publicly available information, and searching for vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>Active Reconnaissance: In this phase, an attacker engages with the target system to gather information actively. It may include techniques like port scanning, vulnerability scanning, and network mapping.</li>
  <li>Social Engineering: Reconnaissance can also involve social engineering techniques to gather information from individuals or organizations. This includes methods like phishing, pretexting, and impersonation.</li>
</ol>
