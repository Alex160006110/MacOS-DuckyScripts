REM Create a hidden directory named .phantom_audio in the home directory.
REM Writes a Python script (record.py) that uses the sox utility to record audio from the microphone and save it as a .wav file. 
REM Once executed, the audio recording will start and continue until manually stopped. 
REM The recording is saved in the .phantom_audio directory under the home directory.
REM Remember to respect privacy and use this script responsibly.
