 First off, all of these [@BADUSB SCRIPTS](https://github.com/narstybits/MacOS-DuckyScripts) NEED to be formated in .txt this is the format The FLipper APP(FAP) BADUSB uses to run your Favorite Scripts!

To upload the .txt files you will need to copy and paste the Raw code into the MacOs application "TextEdit" or whichever program you prefer (TextEdit is Easy)

Once you've copy and pasted the Code into your prefered program you will need to export or save the file to your desktop as a .txt file!

You can type .txt after the file name and it will prompt & save the file as a .txt

Now we can plug the flipper in and open up the File Manager, navigate to the sd card and open up the BADUSB file within the sd card

This is where you can Drag and Drop your .txt files and once you are done close out of the FLipper desktop app.

You are now ready to deploy your DuckyScripts and take over the World! ENJOY :)

<p align="center">  !!!!EXERCISE CAUTION!!!! 
<h1 h1>
when executing code, double-check to ensure that you're targeting the correct directory/System and that the consequences are understood.


Deleting files and folders can have significant consequences! 

It's crucial to !!!!EXERCISE CAUTION!!!!  when performing such actions. Deleting system files or important user data can lead to data loss or system instability. Therefore, it is recommended to proceed with extreme caution and ensure that you have a backup of any important files before executing any commands that involve file deletion.
