  <h3 style="font-size: 32px; margin: 0;">ðŸ”¹ First, Always Read the Remarks</h3>
  <p>When working with the scripts, make sure to carefully read the REM (remark) lines. REMs explain the purpose of each line or provide instructions to the user. It's crucial to always read and understand the REMs!</p>
  
  <h4>The VendorID and ProductID Combination</h4>
  <pre><code>'ID 05ac:021e Apple:Keyboard'</code></pre>
  <p>This code helps the operating system identify the specific device (in this case, the Flipper Zero) and load the appropriate drivers or configurations, such as for an Apple keyboard.</p>
  
  <h4>The 'ignorespace' Option</h4>
  <pre><code>'echo -e "export HISTCONTROL=ignorespace\nunset HISTFILE" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc && exec bash'</code></pre>
  <p>This code enables the 'ignorespace' option for the command history, preventing commands with a leading space from being stored in the shell history. Special thanks to [FalsePhilosopher](https://github.com/FalsePhilosopher) for helping create this string!</p>
  
  <h4>Removing Specific Commands from History</h4>
  <pre><code>history -d $(history | tail -n 2 | head -n 1 | awk '{ print $1 }')</code></pre>
  <p>This code removes the specific command from the history, ensuring minimal traces are left behind and helping maintain discretion and privacy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To upload the .txt files to your Flipper, you have two options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you downloaded the .txt files, proceed to step 2.</li>
      <li>If you copied and pasted the code into a program, export or save the file as a .txt file on your desktop.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plug the Flipper into your computer and open the File Manager.</p>
    <p>Navigate to the SD card and open the BADUSB folder.</p>
    <p>Drag and drop the .txt files into the BADUSB folder.</p>
    <p>Close the Flipper desktop app when finished.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You are now ready to deploy your BADUSB DuckyScripts and take over the world! Enjoy!</li>
