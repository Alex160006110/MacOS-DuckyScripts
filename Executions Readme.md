## Introduction

<p>Penetration testing, also known as ethical hacking, is a process of evaluating the security of a system or network by simulating real-world attacks. This section aims to guide you through the process of executing security tests using Ducky scripts.</p>

<h4>
<ol>
  <li>USB Rubber Ducky: This involves using the USB Rubber Ducky device to inject keystrokes and automate security tests on target systems.</li>
  <li>Ducky Script Emulation: In this method, Ducky scripts are emulated using software tools to execute security tests without physical access to the target system.</li>
</ol>
